Earth, 2021, no educational system exists, islands of enlightenment are held around single teachers-enthusiasts, while the availability of knowledge has reached its maximum in the history of mankind.

Traditional schools and universities are a kargo-cult and an imitation of education, hidden behind formal procedures and existing only by inertia (except for rare non-systemic exceptions). Under these conditions we, professionals of different fields, who ourselves are able and able to reproduce thinking, culture, art, science and technology, take upon ourselves the responsibility to prepare future generations, not only our children, with whom we will naturally begin, but everyone who wishes to join the Metaeducation movement (Metaeducation Global Initiative).

We bring learning and work together in one process, different generations into one team, set the team an interesting and ambitious task, and lead the way to solve engineering questions so that in the process people themselves make lively theoretical generalizations, tied to practice and personal thought experience. Such theory will not be forgotten and will not be superfluous. But it is necessary to begin with examples of thinking of older comrades, to observe their successes and be inspired by their results, so that there is a desire first to help, and then to benefit the common cause, to show their abilities.

Meta because we ourselves will learn, and we will teach those who teach. The Greek word "τέχνη" [tékhnē] may be perceived now as homonymous with technology or engineering, but its meaning is art. We believe that scientific and technical knowledge and the humanities must be inseparably linked and cannot be well mastered separately. We do not separate theory and practice, training and application, learner and learner, the whole process is built on a real useful project that involves all ages and specialties. Training examples can only be used to teach to solve learning problems, and we want to move away from artificial conditions as much as possible and learn through experience and observation of experience gained. We don't simplify and distort knowledge by making it understandable for beginners; we keep in mind that it's harder to retrain than to assimilate advanced knowledge and practice at once. No cajoling, immediately throwing in the hardest problem, everyone will find their role in it, someone will start to solve it and someone will observe the solution. Depth of thought and parsing can be postponed, but the reality and complexity of the real task cannot be postponed.

Our foundations are a passion for our profession, a thirst for knowledge, and a love for the expression of human talent. We form a distributed system in different countries that works on common principles and share prepared materials. Students of any age and their parents can come together anywhere and start their own metaeducation section.

We assume that parents will take an active part in teaching their children themselves, but also invite specialists. We do away with outdated notions of education, such as class and group, year, semester and quarter, session, subject, course, and credit. Education should be continuous and seamless, from birth to death, with no formal division into preschool, school, higher and post-graduate. Everyone moves at their own speed, together with teachers, chooses only what interests them and forms a map and a detailed plan of mastered and planned knowledge, where each topic is recorded independently and there is an external evaluation. For example, this map may include "Arithmetic division" as well as "Color circle", "PID controller", "Correspondence of kings of the ancient world", "Lambda cube", "Invitation to execution", "Taking out the cycle invariant", "The tower of yellow crane", etc. The topics, of course, are built into a system; they form a cross-referenced tree (essentially a link graph) along which the student can navigate, forming a unique profession. Traffic cues can be suggested by teachers, algorithms, and machine learning models that we will develop. The level of understanding of each topic can have gradations from "got to know" to "taught another" and even "made a scientific contribution."

Trust in this system will be shaped by professional trust in the teachers who develop the program and deliver the lectures and workshops, trust in the parents who organize daily discussion, practice, and collaborative projects, and trust in the professionals in different fields whom we will invite regularly to talk about their work, why their work is needed, and why it might be of interest to others. Observing professionals who are passionate about their work and gradually engaging them in productive work is the basis of our approach, giving both motivation, an interesting process, and a useful result.
